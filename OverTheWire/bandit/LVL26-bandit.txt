#so we are stuck in more, and connection closes because the txt(bandit26 ascii banner) in text.txt is short and more does not go into interactive mode, it reads the txt and closes the connection imeaditly

#so we must minimize the terminal window to the point that makes more go into interactive mode and dont close the connection.


ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
#with minimized terminal window we run this comman and go into interactive mode of more, and we see something like this:
  _                     _ _ _   ___   __
 | |                   | (_) | |__ \ / /

 | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __| / / '_ \

#then we press "v" to go into vim, and with ":e" command we can "e=Edit another file" — it closes the current buffer and opens a new file.

(in vim) :e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

#OR we can get a shell from vim

#This launches a full interactive shell
