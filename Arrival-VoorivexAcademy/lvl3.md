# 📋 Initial Info:

### ![img](./imgs/lvl3.png)

---

# 🔍 Initial Analysis:

### - again the first thing we do is to check the source code
### - since it mentioned gallery and a special file(the flag most likely), we should check out the image address in the source code [https://a.voorivex.academy/I4OTgwMWQ3/images/4.jpg]

---

# 🔓 Solving:

### - nothing special in the image itself, but since it said gallery we should check the ./images/ directory
### - we see a file named next.txt here which contains a flag

### ![img](./imgs/lvl3-2.png)
